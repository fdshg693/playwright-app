"""The CLI return contract shared by every `tav` wrapper script.

A caller never has to guess what a wrapper hands back: this module is the
authoritative source of truth for four contracts (the README tables describe the
same thing for humans — keep them in sync):

1. Process exit code -> ``ExitCode`` (an ``IntEnum``). Every ``main()`` returns
   one of these members; callers branch on the number.
2. Emitted data -> ``ResultEnvelope`` (a ``TypedDict``). Every script emits the
   SAME self-describing envelope, with a ``result_kind`` discriminator that tells
   the caller how to read ``result``. Where it lands depends on ``--topic`` (see
   ``OutputChannel`` and the writers in ``topic_layout``): stdout when absent,
   files under the topic folder when present.
3. Full audit log -> ``ResponseEnvelope`` (a ``TypedDict``), written to
   ``logs/<script>-log.json`` whenever logging is on (see ``environment``).
4. Output destination -> ``OutputChannel`` (an ``Enum``). Fixes *where* each of
   the above goes: stdout carries the machine-readable result and nothing else,
   every human/AI notice is a stderr ``DIAGNOSTIC``, and durable records are
   files. ``output.emit()`` is the single sink that routes by this enum.

It also carries the ``RunOutcome`` dataclass — the side-effect-free value a
``main()`` returns — plus the role-layout tables that decide which topic
subfolder a ``result_kind`` is filed under. This module is pure declarations:
no I/O, no Tavily calls (the per-item Tavily response shapes live in
``tavily_types``).
