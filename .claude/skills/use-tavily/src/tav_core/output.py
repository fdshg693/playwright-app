"""The single output sink: serialization, envelope builders, and ``emit()``.

Every stdout / stderr / file write the package performs goes through ``emit()``,
routed by ``OutputChannel`` (defined in ``result_contract``). Keeping this the
ONLY place output happens is what lets the channel enum actually govern where
bytes go, so a caller can parse stdout verbatim and read stderr as pure
diagnostics. The higher-level "given a ``RunOutcome``, file it under the topic
layout" logic lives in ``topic_layout``; this module is the low-level primitives
it builds on.
