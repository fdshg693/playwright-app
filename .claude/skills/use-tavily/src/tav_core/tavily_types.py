"""Tavily per-item result types — EMPIRICALLY pinned, not copied from the docs.

Each TypedDict here names the concrete shape of one object inside the ``result``
list that ``result_contract.ResultKind`` discriminates, as observed from the LIVE
Tavily API (tavily-python 0.7.x) when called with THIS skill's fixed wrapper flags
(``include_raw_content`` / ``include_images`` / ``include_favicon`` all False,
``format="markdown"``). They are deliberately narrower than "some dict":
downstream code may rely on every key declared here. Real captured responses live
in ``tests/fixtures/`` and ``tests/test_result_types.py`` keeps these definitions
honest against them.

Where the published reference disagreed with reality, reality wins (verified
against live responses on 2026-06-10):
  - search items ALWAYS carry a ``raw_content`` key — value ``None`` under our
    flags (the docs imply the key only appears with ``include_raw_content``).
  - extract items carry an UNDOCUMENTED ``title``; ``images`` is a (usually
    empty) list even with ``include_images=False``.
  - crawl items carry ONLY ``url`` + ``raw_content`` (nullable) under our flags
    — no ``title`` / ``images`` / ``favicon``.
  - a completed research response's ``sources[]`` are ``{url, title, favicon}``
    (the docs said ``{url, title, citation}``).
