"""Role-based topic-folder writers: decide *what* output goes *where*.

This module owns the ``--topic`` layout and nothing else. Given a ``--topic``,
output is filed by the *role* of its ``result_kind`` (see ``result_contract``
ROLE tables) so the kinds never mix:

  discovery (search/map) -> one aggregated JSON list per task under search/ or map/
  content   (extract/crawl) -> one Markdown page per URL under pages/ + index.json
  report    (research) -> one Markdown report under research/ (success only)

Without a ``--topic``, a single projected ``ResultEnvelope`` goes to stdout.
``emit_payload`` is the entry point (called by ``run_shell.finalize``); it writes
the audit log, then dispatches to the per-role writers (topic path) or stdout. It
borrows item shaping from ``projection`` and the single output sink from
``output`` — it only decides destinations, never how a run is finalized
(``run_shell``) or which keys survive (``projection``).
